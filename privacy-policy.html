                        Services from our Sites or Apps, you provide us or our third party payment processor with
                        information necessary to complete the transaction, which may include your name, credit card

                        feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any
                        other content included in the e-mail. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect
                        additional profile information. We also collect other types of personal information and

                        assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session),
                        domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Our BigBlueButton hosting will collect
                        first name, last name, length you stayed in a session and any information you share during your
                        session, which includes audio, response to polls, raise hand, chat messages and video. We also
                        use cookies and web beacons (as described below) and URLs to gather information regarding the

                        each time you visit our Sites, use our Apps, or access your account on our network. We may link

                        California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that
                        share customer personal information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing
                        purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices
                        related to such information-sharing. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not
                        to disclose a customer’s personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct
                        marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such
                        information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As described in this Privacy Policy, you
                        can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for the third
                        parties’ direct marketing purposes by emailing us at legal@bigbluebutton.org. To find out more

                        during any calendar year.
